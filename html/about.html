		<div class = "title">Introduction</div>
		<p class="general">Hello, my name is John Volpatti (which shouldn't be surprising considering the home page of my website) and I am a third year Industrial Engineering student at the <a href = "https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>. I love working with people and am passionate about optimizing the operations of a business and product management.</p>

		<div class = "title">Work Experience</div>
		<p class = "general">This past summer (2020), I worked as a Client Acquisition and Engagement Intern at <a href = "https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/">TD Bank</a>. My term started in June and involved developing and implementing strategies that encourage TD clients to open and stay active with a Direct Investing account.</p>
		<p class="general">Last summer (2019), I worked as a reasearch intern for the <a href="https://hfast.mie.utoronto.ca/">Human Factors and Applied Statisics (HFASt) Lab</a> at the Univeristy of Toronto. Immersed in a professional lab setting, I handled the collection and organization of large amounts of data used by graduate students to characteriize driver behaviour. I also contributed to the creation of a database to store online survey results, which involved SQL and C.</p>
		<p class="general">And two summers ago (2018), I worked as a math instructor at <a href = "https://www.mathnasium.ca/leaside">Mathnasium</a>. I assigned worksheets to students based on their math foundation, marked their worksheets and explained concepts in a simple and coherent way.</p>

		<div class = "title">Upcoming Plans</div>
		<p class="general">For the winter semester of 2021, I plan on spending a semester abroad at <a href = "https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a> in Switzerland under the Computational Science and Engineering program.</p>
