		<p class="general">In addition to working this past summer, I  completed a summer course in AI fundamentals. For the final project, my group and I developed a GRU (type of RNN) to classify news articles as real or fake. The dataset was collected from Kaggle, where it was preprocessed by our code. We then converted the words in each article to GloVe embeddings and fed them into our model. The model reported a final testing accuracy of 98.8%. See github repo here.</p>
		<p class="general">Last year, Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC) asked my group to develop an interface to communicate multiple levels of military information to generals. After many exchanges  with the DRDC representative and many iterations of designs, our team delivered our solution to the DRDC in a well-organized report.</p>

		<p class = "general">For the past year, I have been a market analyst at the <a href = "https://www.utefa.com/">University of Toronto Engineering Finance Association (UTEFA) </a> - the acronym was definitely needed. During my time at UTEFA, I pitched stocks I believed would be a good investment for UTEFA. My presentations consisted of qualitative as well as quantitative research on the company. I will be resuming my role at UTEFA next year. </p>
		<p class="general">I am also a Business Strategy Associate at <a href = "https://yourenext.ca/">You're Next Career Network (YNCN)</a>, a student-run body focused on helping students explore different career options. I reach out to companies to get them to attend the career fairs and networking events.</p>
